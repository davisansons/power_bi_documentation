# **DAX Functions**

There are over 250 functions that can be used in Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)formulas. 

These functions can be divided into 14 categories:

### **Aggregation Function**
These functions calculate a (scalar) value such as count, sum, average, minimum, or maximum for all rows in a column or table as defined by the expression.

### **Date and Time Functions**
These functions help create calculations based on dates and times. They use a **datetime** data type, and can take values from a column as an argument.

### **Filter Functions**
These functions allow you to manipulate data contexts to create dynamic calculations. 

### **Financial Functions**
These functions are used in formulas that perform financial calculations, such as net present value and rate of return. These functions are similar to the ones used in Microsoft Excel.

### **Information Functions**
These functions look at a table or column provided as an argument to another function and returns whether the value matches the expected type. For example, the **ISERROR** function returns TRUE if the value referenced contains an error.

### **Logical Functions**
These functions return information about values in an expression. For example, the TRUE function lets you know whether an expression you are evaluating returns a TRUE value. 

### **Math and Trig Functions**
DAX provides a large number of mathematical and trigonometric functions that can be used in calculations. 

### **Other Functions**
These functions perform unique actions that cannot be defined by any of the categories that most other functions belong to.

### **Parent and Child Functions**
These functions help users manage data that is presented as a parent/child hierarchy in their data model. Using these functions allows you to obtain the lineage of parents a row has, the number of levels in the lineage, who the parent is and who the descendant is.

### **Relationship Functions**
These functions are for managing and utilizing relationships between tables. For example, you can specify a particular relationship to be used in a calculation.

### **Statistical Functions**
These functions calculate values related to statistical distributions and probability, such as standard deviation and number of permutations. 

### **Table Manipulation Functions**
These functions return a table or manipulate existing tables.

### **Text Functions**
These functions can return part of a string, search for text, or concatenate string values. 

### **Time Intelligence Functions**
These functions help you create calculations that use built-in knowledge about calendars and dates. By using time and date ranges in combination with aggregations or calculations, you can build meaningful comparisons across comparable time periods.

# **Get Started Building with Power BI**
This module covers how Power BI services and applications work together,
how Power BI can make businesses more efficient and how to create
compelling visualisations and reports.

## **Introduction**
Power BI is a collection of services, apps, and connectors that turn data into coherent, immersive and interactive insights. Power BI allows you to connect
to various sources to visualise data and create reports that can be shared across
the business.

### **The Parts of Power BI**
Power BI consists of a desktop application called Power BI Desktop, an online
SaaS service called the Power BI Service, and mobile Power BI apps that are available
on any device.

### **The Common Flow of Work in Power BI**
A common flow of work in Power BI begins with Power BI Desktop, where the reports are
created. These reports are then published to the Power BI Service and shared so that 
Power BI Mobile users can consume the information.

## **Building Block of Power BI**
Power BI can be broken down into several building blocks:

### **Visualisations**
A visualisation is a visual representation of data. Power BI has many types of visualisations with more being added. The goal of a visual is to present data in a way
to provides context and insights, both of which would be difficult to gather from
raw data.

### **Datasets**
A dataset is a collection of data that Power BI uses to create visualisations.

Datasets can be a combination of different sources, which can be filtered and combined to provide a unique collection of data. 

Filtering data before bringing it into Power BI allows you to focus on the data that
is important. This creates a subset that allows you to focus on a specific area of
interest. 

### **Reports**
A report is a collection of visualisations that appear together on one or more pages.
They are a collection of items that are related to each other. Reports let you create
many visualisations, on multiple pages if necessary, and let you arrange those
visualisations in whatever way needed to tell a story.

### **Dashboards**
When you're ready to share a report, or a collection of visualisations, you create a
dashboard. A dashboard is a collection of visuals that you can share with others. A
dashboard must fit on a single page. Dashboards can take visualisations from various
sources and bring them into one view. 

### **Tiles**
In Power BI, a tile is a single visualisation on a dashboard. These can be moved or
arranged however required. When viewing the dashboard, you can interact with the tiles,
however you cannot change the size or arrangement.

## **Tour and use the Power BI Service**
An easy and popular way to make visuals quickly is to user Power BI Apps. An app is
a collection of preset, ready-made visuals and reports that are shared with an entire
organisation.

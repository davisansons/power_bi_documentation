# Discover Data Analysis
Learn how a data analyst tells a story with data. This module covers the different tasks of a data analyst. 

## Introduction
Data is the most strategic asset of a business, and the challenge is to understand and use it positively affect change within the business.
Having data alone is not enough. It is important to tell a story. The underlying challenge is to  understand and use the data in a way that
impacts the business and their bottom line. 

Story telling with data also involves building a data culture within the organisation. It is important to consider who the story is being
told to, while making sure that they are able to discover the story, find it, and make it part of their regular interactions.

## Overview of Data Analysis
To tell a story data must first go through a process that makes it usable. Data analysis is the process of identifying, cleaning, transforming,
and modeling data to discover meaningful and useful information. 

Data driven businesses make decisions based on the story that the data tells. Therefore data analysis should be a critical aspect of all 
organisations who wish to determine the performance of their business. 

To analyse data, core components of analytics are divided into the following categories:

### Descriptive Analytics
Descriptive analytics answers questions based on historical data and summarises large datasets to describe outcomes to stakeholders.

By developing KPIs, this analysis can help track success or failure. Metrics such as ROI and more specialised metrics are used to track
performance depending on the requirements of the business and the industry it operates in.

### Diagnostic Analytics
Diagnostic analytics answer questions about why events happened by supplementing basic descriptive analysis, and using those findings
to discover the cause of these events. Performance indicators are used to further investigate why events improved or worsened. Generally this
can be done with the following steps:
* Identify anomalies in the data. 
* Collect data related to these anomalies.
* Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies. 

### Predictive Analytics
Predictive analytics answers questions about what will happen in the future. Predictive analytics techniques use historical data to identify
trends and determine if they are likely to recur. Techniques include a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques such as
neural networks, decision trees and regression.

### Prescriptive Analytics
Prescriptive analytics help answer questions about the actions that should be taken. This allows the business to make informed decisions.
Machine learning is one of the strategies to find patterns in data. By analysing past decisions and events, organisations can estimate
likelihood of different outcomes.

### Cognitive Analytics
Cognitive analytics attempt to draw inferences from existing data and patterns, derive conclusions based on existing knowledge bases, and
then add these findings back into the knowledge base for future inferences, a self-learning feedback loop. This can help you learn what might
happen if circumstances change and determine how they might be handled. 

## Roles in Data
There are a number of different roles in data:

### Business Analyst
A business analyst is close to the business and specialises in interpreting the data that comes from the visualisations. Often the roles
of data analyst and business analyst are the responsibility of one person.

### Data Analyst
A data analyst maximises the value of data through visualisations and reporting tools. Data analysts profile, clean and transform data.
The role also involves designing and building scalable and effective data models, and enabling and implementing the advanced analytics
capabilities into reports. Data analysts work with stakeholders to gather requirements, and then turning raw data into meaningful insights.

Data analyst manage the reporting assets such as reports, dashboards, workspaces, and the underlying datasets used in the reports. This
also includes managing security procedures to ensure safekeeping of assets. 

A data analyst works closely with data engineers to determine and locate appropriate data sources. This also includes making sure the data
analyst has proper access to the required data sources. Data analysts will work with data engineers to identify new processes or improve
existing ones for collecting data.

### Data Engineer
Data engineers provision and set up data platform technologies both on-premises and on the cloud. They manage and secure the flow of
structured and unstructured data from multiple sources. This includes relational databases, non-relational databases, data streams and
file stores. Data engineers also ensure that data services securely and seamlessly integrate across data platforms. 

Data engineers use on-premise and cloud service tools to ingest, egress, and transform data from multiple sources. 

### Data Scientist
Data scientists perform advanced analytics to extract value from data. Their work can vary from descriptive analytics to predictive analytics.
Descriptive analytics uses the process of exploratory data analysis (EDA). Predictive analytics are used in machine learning to apply modeling
techniques that can detect anomalies or patterns. 

Some data scientists work in the realm of deep learning, performing iterative experiments to solve a complex data problem by using customised
algorithms. However, most of the work in a data science project is spent on data wrangling and feature engineering. 

### Database Administrator
A database administrator implements and manages operational aspects of cloud-native and hybrid data platform solutions. They are responsible
for the overall availability and consistent performance of the database solutions. They work with stakeholders to identify and implement the
policies, tools, and processes for data backup and recovery plans. 

Database administrators monitor and manage the overall health of a database and the hardware it resides on. They are responsible for managing
the overall security of the data, granting and restricting user access and privileges to the data as determined by business needs and requirements.

## Tasks of a Data Analyst
A data analyst uncovers and makes sense of information. They are essential in helping organisations gain insight and work closely with others to
help reveal valuable information. There are five key areas to the data analysis process:

### Prepare
Deficient or incorrect data can have a major impact that results in invalid reports, a loss of trust, and a negative effect on business decisions,
which can lead to a loss in revenue, a negative business impact, and more. 

Data preparation is the process of profiling, cleaning, and transforming your data to get it ready to model and visualise. This process also
includes taking raw data and turning it into information that is trusted and understandable. It involves, among other things, ensuring the
integrity of the data, correcting wrong or inaccurate data, identifying missing data, converting data from one structure to another, or
even simply making the data more readable. 

Data preparation also involves understanding how you're going to get and connect to the data and the performance implications of the decisions.
When connecting to data, you need to make decisions to ensure that models and reports meet, and perform to, acknowledged requirements
and expectations. 

Privacy and security assurances are also important. These assurances can include anonymizing data to avoid oversharing or preventing
people from seeing personally identifiable information. 

### Model
When the data has been prepared it can be modeled. This involves determining how tables are related to each other. This process
is done by defining and creating relationships between tables. From that point, you can enhance the model by defining metrics
and adding custom calculations to enrich data. 

An effective model makes reports more accurate, allows the data to be explored faster and more efficient, decreases waiting time for
the report writing process, and simplifies future report maintenance. 

From a reporting perspective, if the report is performing slowly, or refreshes are taking a long time, you will likely need to revisit
the data preparation and modeling tasks to optimise your report.

The process of preparing data and modeling ata is an iterative process.

### Visualise
Visualisation brings data to life. The ultimate goal is to solve business problems. A well-designed report should tell a compelling story
about the data. By using effective visualisations and interactions you can provide an effective report that guides the reader through
the content quickly and efficiently.

The reports created help stakeholders understand the data so that accurate decisions can be made. Reports drive the overall actions,
decisions, and behaviours of an organisation. 

As a data analyst, you should take the time to fully understand the problem being solved. 

An important aspect of visualisation is designing and creating reports for accessibility. It is important to think about people who will be 
accessing and reading the reports. Reports should be designed with accessibility in mind from the outset so that no special modifications
are required in the future. 

### Analyse
Analysing requires understanding and interpreting the information that is displayed on the report. This involves finding insights,
identifying patterns and trends, predict outcomes, and then communicate those insights in a way that everyone can understand. 

### Manage
As a data analyst you are responsible for managing assets, overseeing the sharing and distribution of items, and ensuring appropriate
security measures. The management of content helps foster collaboration between teams and individuals.

Proper management of data can reduce data silos in organisations, therefore reducing data duplication which could cause latency.
